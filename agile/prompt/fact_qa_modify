For each product ([question], [answer]) pair, rewrite the [question] and the [answer]. For the [answer], provide a detailed long_answer followed by a short_answer. The long_answer should preserve the semantic of raw [answer], while the short_answer should be a direct response that can be evaluated through an exact match method. The short_answers must be "yes" or "no" or consist only of key entities relevant to the question. For the [question], rewrite the question to be more specific and precise, which suitable for both the long_answer and the short_answer.

**Guidelines for question:**
1. Be specific and precise, just ask once question.
2. Avoid ambiguous language.

**Guidelines for long_answer:**
1. Be explicit and concise.
2. Write in full sentences, ensuring clarity and coherence.

**Guidelines for short_answer:**
1. If the question is a yes/no type, the short_answer should be plainly "yes" or "no", without punctuation.
2. If the question asks for specifics, list only the entities (e.g., items in a set, features of a product) without additional explanation. Following the following format: [entity1, entity2, ...]
3. Avoid ambiguous language; the short_answer should be clear and decisive.
